CRATES AND PACKAGES

- A crate is a binary or library
- The Crate Root is the source file that the compiler starts from, makes up root module

- A package is one or more crates that provide a set of functionality
- A package contains a cargo.toml file that describes how to build the crates
- A package must contain zero or 1 library, no more 
- A package can contain as many binbary crates but must contain at least 1

To create a package run 
`cargo new {project-name}`

- src/main.rs will be the create root of a binary crate with the same name as the package
- src/lib.rs will be the library crate with the same name as the package
